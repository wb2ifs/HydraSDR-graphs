# HydraSDR-graphs
Here are my [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) companion graph files for the [HydraSDR RFOne](https://hydrasdr.com/) receiver. They are based on the [demonstration FM receiver in this tutorial](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=RTL-SDR_FM_Receiver). Hack them, enjoy them, share them.

You'll see two files:
+ **Hydra_fm_rx.grc** is the basic demonstration graph file
+ **Hydra_fm_rcv_stereo.grc** is the stereo version of the receiver

Here's a quick and dirty video of my development of the graph files.

**Note: you must install the [HydraSDR forked versions of the rfone_host tools](https://github.com/hydrasdr) before working with GNURadio companion.**
